# PLVS II

### v0.2.1

Author: [Luigi Freda](https://www.luigifreda.com)


PLVS is a real-time system that combines sparse SLAM, volumetric mapping, and 3D unsupervised incremental segmentation. PLVS stands for **Points**, **Lines**, **Volumetric mapping**, and **Segmentation**.

PLVS is available in two different versions.
- **PLVS I**: hosted in the branch `plvs1`. It is based on [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2), and supports mono, stereo, and RGB-D cameras.
- **PLVS II**: hosted in the `master` branch. It is based on [ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3), and also supports camera systems provided with IMUs. 

This [document](./new_features.md) provides a list of the **new features** provided by PLVS.

**Note**: PLVS is an active project. This *README* is under construction and will be updated with further information and details as new improvements are released. Stay tuned!

  
## Quick start 

The following procedures were tested under **Ubuntu 20, 22, 24**. ROS support is provided only under **noetic** with **Ubuntu 20** (see [here](#ros-build)).  
If you don't have Ubuntu 20 with noetic, check [rosdocker](https://github.com/luigifreda/rosdocker) and use the *noetic* or *noetic_cuda* containers.

**NOTE**: At present, under Ubuntu 24.04, `BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE` is set to `OFF`. Enabling `--march=native` optimization brings some problems probably due to different default building options in the native `libpcl`.

### Build

1. Install basic dependencies:      
  `$ ./install_dependencies.sh`        
2. Install *OpenCV* in a local folder:                 
  `$ ./install_local_opencv.sh`         
3. Build the *PLVS* framework:       
  `$ ./build.sh`

It should be easy to adapt the above procedures if you have a different OS version. 

If you want to skip step 2, you can set the variables `OpenCV_DIR` and `OPENCV_VERSION` in `config.sh` with your local *OpenCV* path and version, respectively. However, this is not recommended. 

### ROS build

Only under **ROS noetic** you can run:        
`$ ./build_ros_catkin.sh`       

This command builds the *PLVS* ROS workspace and deploys it in the `ros_ws` folder.



### Running the examples 

Once everything is built, you can enter in the `Scripts` folder and test the different examples. For instance you can configure and run: 
- `$ ./run_tum_rgbd.sh` for TUM RGB-D datasets 
- `$ ./run_kitti_stereo.sh` for KITTI datasets
- `$ ./run_euroc_stereo_inertial.sh` for Euroc datasets, stereo + inertial
- `$ ./run_euroc_stereo.sh` for Euroc datasets, only stereo
- `$ ./run_tum_vi_stereo.sh` for TUM VI datasets, only stereo
- `$ ./run_tum_vi_stereo_inertial.sh` for TUM VI datasets, stereo + inertial

In each of the above scripts, you have to configure *(1)* the `DATASET_BASE_FOLDER`, *(2)* the specific `DATASET` of interest, and *(3)* the used `YAML` configuration file. In particular, each `YAML` configuration file shows different sections with commented options. For a quick overview of the **new features** and their corresponding `YAML` options refer to [new_features.md](./new_features.md).   

If you built the ROS workspace, you can use the scripts `ros_xterm*` to launch the PLVS ROS nodes. For instance, with the TUM datasets, run `ros_xterm_tum_rgbd.sh`.
